# InterpScipy
Comparison of Scipy interpolation methods for 2D unstructured data.

This repository investigates the properties of different Scipy interpolation functions for a 2D unstructured field which is the solution of the Advection-Diffusion PDE.
Different methods are compared in terms of accuracy and speed. To see the results simply change the working directory to the folder containg the files and run 'InterpolationMethods.py' in a Python console.

For details on the interpolation functions, see the manual at:
    https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html

I also found the discussion in the link below very useful:
